There's a phone catalog. It's a single-page application to search any device to buy. The page consists of a header, a footer and some tabs. The header contains a logo, a navigation, two buttons that navigate to appropriate tabs and on some of these tabs seach input is placed here. On small screens the navigation replaced with a menu button. The menu contains the navigation in itself. There're such tabs as home, phones, tablets, accessories, favourites and a cart. A photo slider, two products sliders and a block of products categories are located on the home tab. Phones, tablets and accessories maintains conforming products with filters. Favourites is similar to privious ones but contains product cards were sele—Åted. The cart in needed to view the products you want to buy, also it's possible to increase or decrease quantity of wishful goods or delete them from the cart at all. The footer contains the logo and contacts.

I used React with Typescript, React-router, Redux, CSS, Sass, DOM, BEM to create this project.
