There's a phone catalog. It's a single-page application to search any device to buy. The page consists of a header, a footer and some tabs. The header contains a logo, a navigation, two buttons that navigate to appropriate tabs and on some of these tabs search input is placed here. On small screens the navigation replaced with a menu button. The menu contains the navigation in itself. There are such tabs as home, phones, tablets, accessories, favourites and a cart. A photo slider, two products sliders and a block of product categories are located on the home tab. Phones, tablets and accessories maintains conforming products with filters. Favourites are similar to previous ones but contains product cards were selected. The cart in needed to view the products you want to buy, also it's possible to increase or decrease quantity of wishful goods or delete them from the cart at all. The footer contains the logo and contacts.

I used React with Typescript, React-router, Redux, CSS, Sass, DOM, BEM to create this project.
